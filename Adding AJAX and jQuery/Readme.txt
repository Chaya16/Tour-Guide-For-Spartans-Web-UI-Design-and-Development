We’ve created a homepage to show what the future website might look like. The use case that we have prototyped is the Signup and Login use case.Instructions to test the sign up and login feature:1.The server code is included in the file “server.js”. To start the application run the following command at the installed path:” node server.js”. Then in the browser open the following url: “localhost:3000/”. The homepage of our website will be visible here. (You can also try localhost:3000/homepage, to visit the homepage of our website)2.Click on the “log in” link in the top right corner. This will redirect you to the log-in page.3. Enter “admintest” for both the username and password fields in the login page. A blank value for either username or password or any other input will result in a a message displayed which asks you to enter your credentials again.4. Below the log in button, there is a link to take you to the sign-up page. * Username and password cannot be blank and this has been handled by our code. * The restriction for both username and password for our website is that they have to be 5 to 12 characters long and only letters (uppercase or lowercase) and digits are allowed* If you register with an existing username like “admintest”, you will get a message saying that the username already exists. * Since we are not using database or any other external means to store the credentials currently, you can’t use your sign-up details to log in to our website.
